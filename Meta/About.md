# About
  

`KaaS` (Knowledge as a Service) is an [[Obsidian]] Vault composed of a multitude of notes on a variety of topics that interest me.

Inside is my personal, customized, digital knowledge notebase structured loosely as a [[Zettelkasten]], a collection of interlinked [[Atomic Notes]] about anything that interests me.

Consider this my *Digital Garden*. It is a garden that needs to be maintained and cared for overtime to produce fruitful outcomes.

## Features

- Notes are stored locally and are written in [[Markdown]]
- Notes are versioned and tracked in [[Version Control]] with [[Git]] and [[GitHub]]
- Notes are published in two separate manners: 
	- Open Source Method: Uses [[GitHub Actions]] and [[MkDocs]] 
	- [[Obsidian Publish]]
- Hosted on my personal domain *jimbrig.com*
- Synced via [[Obsidian Sync]] between machines and for use on mobile devices and tablets  

## Structure


  

### Note Types

- [[Daily-Notes/_README|Daily Notes]]: Daily notes for journaling and reflection
- [[Meta/_README|Meta]]
- [[Literary Notes/README]]: Notes representing external ideas and knowledge that I have captured.
- [[Permanent Notes/README]]: Notes that are considered *Evergreen*, i.e., notes that I have curated and formulated.
- [[Concept Notes]]: Notes that are just describing or defining a concept or idea.
- [[Placeholders/README|Structural Notes or Placeholders]]: Structure notes are notes that organize other notes
- Source Notes: similar to Literary Notes, but denote a structure specific to a type of input/source:

- Article

- Post

- Video

- Podcast

- Mindsweep

- Code Snippet

- Repository

  

These sources are maintained using Obsidian's Tagging feature and currently I have the following nested tags under root tag `#Type/`:

- `#Type/Article`

- `#Type/Book`

- `#Type/Video`

- `#Type/Podcast`

- `#Type/Idea`

- `#Type/Project`

- `#Type/Mindsweep`

- `#Type/Code`

- `#Type/WriteUp`

- `#Type/Diagram`

  

Other types that aren't necessarily *sources*:

  

- `#Type/MOC`

- `#Type/Daily`

- `#Type/Meta`

- `#Type/Framework`

-
