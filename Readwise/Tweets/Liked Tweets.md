- @tracyplaces: EXAMPLE: Matt, Mark, Brandon, Andy, and Ramses are known to search their graphs for:
  • I want

  If you are and you tell me you're not a journaler, I'm pretty sure you need to:

  • Come up with a broader definition of journaling. 😉

- @TfTHacker: From time to time I talk about the importance of documenting your workflows. This is a great example of how to do it. 
  The idea is to have a clear plan how you process knowledge from collection to its final home.
  In this way, your system take on greater meaning & value. https://t.co/zMY0vHKA2o ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TfTHacker/status/1500443540144463872))

- @henrikbengtsson: Fresh out of the #RStats oven:
  It is now (= R-devel to become R 4.2.0) possible to use underscore (_) as a placeholder on the right-hand side (RHS) of a forward pipe, e.g.

- @_ColinFay: This week I gave the last session of a 4 days training on JavaScript for {shiny}. 
  Attendees were seasoned shiny devs, and were amazed by the extent of what you can do with {shiny} once you start mastering JS & understanding how both can work together. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_ColinFay/status/1532251620578410497))
- @_ColinFay: If you stick to R wrappers for JS libs... that's probably 0,1% of what JS can offer. 
  Once you start mastering JS <> {shiny}, "the sky is the limit". Most of the time you can pick a JS lib online and plug it into your app. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_ColinFay/status/1532251622306357248))
- @_ColinFay: Anyway, my number one advice for {shiny} devs is to start learning JS, and all the web technologies. That will def take your apps to the next level. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_ColinFay/status/1532251623648645120))

- @meghansharris: Soon I'll be at #rstudioconf sharing my story about making data pipelines in #rstats! Pipelines is a HUGE topic, so this will serve as a high-level glimpse into the essential things I learned about making them while having to teach myself along the way!

- @adhdwhatnext: @fortelabs Tiago - interested that you digest the negative reviews so thoroughly. Reminds me of the M.A.S.H. episode where a marine swallowed an entire Jeep piece by piece. 
  I salute your fortetude. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adhdwhatnext/status/1547427286286159872))
- @fortelabs: @adhdwhatnext I find them so entertaining. And I appreciate how much they have to care to write about it so pointedly ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1547428091613495296))
- @BoringNuance: @fortelabs Mad respect for not only facing the reviews but posting them in your own feed. You’ve got a tricky position because some of the people who seek out this book - and a disproportionate amount of those who will leave reviews - are already obsessed with PKM.

- @roddaut: @fortelabs I'm so glad you take these negative reviews so well.
  Amazing they took the time to read through and still didn't realize how useful the material is though.
  Maybe just not useful to them? 🤷 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/roddaut/status/1547615103217913859))
- @mniehaus: Microsoft announces Windows 12 :-) https://t.co/o8cCIFmU3z ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mniehaus/status/1547635479859720194))
- @Al_Humphreys: @polarben @fortelabs Haha! Ouch! Weirdly, since I've started highlighting my own bad reviews, I actually get disappointed when I haven't received one for a while!
  It's excellent reverse psychology / DIY therapy... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Al_Humphreys/status/1547651002601332736))
