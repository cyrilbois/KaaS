## Highlights
- During my consultant years, notes were mere drafting vessels. I had notes for everything: meetings, org charts, business proposals, problem mapping, talks, architectural discussions, and so forth. This effort made me spend piles of notebooks, note pads, post-it notes, drafting paper, and whiteboard pictures. In common, it was all disposable again. Because, in the end, most of it became an end “product” like a report, a meeting minute, a UML diagram, a use case, or a story. I had very little attachment to them since most of the work was based on frameworks like RUP, PMBOK, Scrum, and others.
- I do not consider myself a role model of personal organization, but I feel like maintaining things tidy helps me keep my life in balance. I feel much more on track with my things and topics with this improved note system. Raging from the strategy for my organization, projects I’m tackling, the people I’m leading, and my personal feelings. Having it all segregated felt right in the past, but now I can see it all connected and making sense. And this togetherness is very helpful in helping me see my life as a whole and act upon it.
