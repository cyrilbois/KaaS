## Highlights
- Traditional storage systems are not suitable for keeping and processing raw data. Consequently, companies need solutions that help manage data at a diverse yet integrated data tier. The data lakes concept can resolve this issue.
- Data lakes are becoming a necessary part of any corporate data ecosystem. The global data lake market presumably will have grown from $8.81 billion in 2021 to $20.1 billion by 2024. Research predicts nearly 10% revenue growth for companies using this technology.
- The data lake is the backbone of todayâ€™s big data environment.
