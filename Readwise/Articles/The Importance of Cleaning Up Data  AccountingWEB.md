## Highlights
- Many analysts use Excel to summarise cleaned-up data and convert it into information, with structured (sorted and/or ordered) referencing, so that users may understand their numbers, identify trends and produce various reports. To understand what I mean, as an example, we may receive data like this: and we may turn it into something more informative, such as this: Each attribute (known as a field) in a table typically contains a category of data. A crosstab query (similar to the one pictured, above) summarises the data from one or more of these fields that are separated into groups based on one or more fields. Essentially, a crosstab query summarises data in more than one dimension to provide insight that may not be immediately forthcoming otherwise. For example, given the source data, how could you possibly notice that Sales for Quarter 4 in the South are very low relative to other quarters and regions? Excel has many useful tools that will assist, centred on its version of an enhanced crosstab query, known as a PivotTable. However, the subject here is not PivotTables. There is an important first stage I want to discuss here: that is, turning data into information we can use – and that requires cleaning up our data.
- Data is central to everything we do in Excel. When you receive data for analysis, you don't always have control over the format, structure, positioning/placement, appearance and/or type of data that you import from an external data source, such as a database, text file or a web page.
- Before you can analyse the data, you often need to clean it up. Excel has many features that may assist. Sometimes, the task is straightforward and there is a specific feature that does the job for you. For example, you can spell check, remove duplicates or remove all emboldening.
- Get & Transform on the ‘Data’ tab for manipulating your data in Excel. This powerful Extract, Transform and Load (“ETL”) tool is especially useful for creating connections to data (“extraction”), manipulating as you require (“transformation”) and linking / storing it in Excel (“loading”).
