## Highlights
- My colleagues and I utilize a small Postgres database on Microsoft Azure to hold data relevant to a project we are currently working on. Not everyone on my team is experienced using programming languages to upload .csv files to the database and I often get requests to upload files for them. After about the tenth time I decided to create a application using R Shiny that allows users to upload .csv files to the database themselves.
- Because of security protocols, we can only access the database while on the corporate VPN. This made hosting a shiny application on shinyapps.io impossible. So, my next thought was to create a desktop application that a user could install and run locally and access the database. I experimented with Electronjs, Neutralinojs, and NWjs but found it very difficult to merge these frameworks with R Shiny. I did, however, copy the idea from these frameworks to use Chromium browser to create a clean window interface for the application (as opposed to simply opening it in the default browser).
- I then turned to Inno Setup. Itâ€™s a program that creates windows desktop installers. I created a file on my computer call Database App and copied the entire source code for R-4.1.2, Chromium Browser, and a single app.R shiny application.
