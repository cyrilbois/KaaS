## Highlights
- Audio with howler.js
  howler.js is an audio library that makes working with audio in JavaScript easy and reliable across all platforms. {howler} is a wrapper for howler.js, creating an audio player that can handle multiple tracks and seamlessly switch between them. A variety of buttons are available that can trigger events on the player, and are easily customisable.
- Video with video.js
  video.js is another JavaScript library, focussing on providing consistent video behaviour across all web browsers, being able to embed videos from a variety of different sources. {video} is the wrapper for this library, and creates a video player that is easy to communicate between the UI and server of shiny applications.
