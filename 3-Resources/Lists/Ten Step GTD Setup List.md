## Capture Steps

### 1) Capture Incoming Paper into a Single In-Tray

Take a couple of minutes to perform a quick assessment of all paper and other physical *stuff* in my life right now:

|                                       What?                                        | Number of Locations |
|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:-------------------:|
|                                   Piles of Paper                                   |      ~3-5               |
|                                    Sticky Notes                                    |          N/A           |
|                                     Reminders                                      |             ~2        |
|                                     Task Lists                                     |               ~8      |
|                                Notebooks with Notes                                |                 ~10    |
|                                  Paper Calendars                                   |                  N/A   |
|                             Other Paper Products I use                             |                   ~3  |
| Miscellaneous things in or around my area that are not where or how they should be |                   ~15  |


#### 1a) Setup Two In-Trays to Serve as my "In"

Keep one tray for work and one for personal.

NOTES:
- Keep in-trays within arms reach on top of desk.
- Allow personal in-tray to be collaborative with others in household
- Label the trays and place in suggested locations

#### 1b) Gather Loose Papers, Notes, and Reminders and Place into In-Tray

- Gather all incoming mail, lists of things to do, reminders, sticky notes, and anything else that requires attention. **ALL OF IT**.
- Put the items for WORK in work in-tray
- Put the items for HOME in home in-tray

*Note: This move is key -- it is the first essential part of the GTD Practice. The experience gained from performing this move will likely give a sense of taking positive steps to get organize and in control of all that paper and stuff lying about and coming to me each day. Your in-tray should be the only landing spot for anything incoming.*

Other Capture Notes:

In this first step, make sure to **Capture** all *incoming stuff*. This includes:

- Email
- Papers
- Notes from Meetings
- Commitments that come up in conversations/meetings
- Ideas
- Anything on your mind that you need to remember
- Anything that has your attention
- Any coulds, woulds, shoulds, need-tos, might-want-tos, etc. 

Anything that has not already been documented.

Gather these items in a *Trusted Place*.

Note: DO NOT **Do** anything other than capture.

Ways to capture:

- Physical In-Tray
- Pen and Paper
- Smartphone
- Email and Texts
- Online Browsing and Bookmarks
- Read Later Apps and Lists
- Physical Mail
- Ideas and personal project endeavors

### 2) Choose Capture Tool

When nothing seems to move forward, it's due to the fact that no one captured the *item that needs action*. Next Actions are fundamental to making progress in life. Capturing - and keeping track of - your actionable items is critical to success. 

This move, capturing actionable items by writing them down is a powerful driving force to use to keep yourself and others moving forward productively. This simple process will not only improve ability to complete things, but will also encourage an action focus in those around you.

#### 2a) Always Have Capture Tool at Hand

- This could be smartphone, pen and paper, pocket book, etc.

- **Smartphone:**
	- Note taking app
	- Recording / Voice Memos
	- Send emails to yourself

- **Pen and Paper:** Self-Explanatory

**Reality Check: What is your Personal Preference?**

- Take a moment and be honest with yourself, and find out which capture tool you naturally gravitate towards.

1. There is no right answer - just what's right for you -- so are you digital or paper?
2. How do you currently and naturally capture things?
3. If you had to choose the ideal way to capture next actions, how would you like to do it?

#### 2b) Capture Each Actionable Item or Idea as it Occurs - Especially in Meetings, Conversations, and Personal Reflections

Don't let any more good ideas or agreed-upon actions slip through the cracks.

#### 2c) At Least Once a Day, Collect Captured Notes and Put the into In-Tray

- Notes from meetings
- Odd scratch notes
- Ideas written down

#### Notes

Fewer tools is better.

Be sure to move captured items into in-tray daily or onto one of your lists directly.
