## Highlights
- The GTD method is founded on the principle that a clear mind is a happy mind. And when you’re able to take control of your work and commitments, and see it all laid out in front of you, knowing the what and when of your next step for each one, it’s incredibly freeing.
- Confidence in the face of uncertainty
- When you’re able to see all of your tasks, big and small, laid out digitally or on paper, it’s much easier to approach them with confidence. You know exactly what needs to be done and when so you can focus on taking action in the right place (context) and the right time (priority and energy) instead of feeling overwhelmed by everything on your plate.
- Dealing with the constant stream of information and requests that come your way
- With GTD, you have a system in place for dealing with all your different inboxes, physical, electronic, mental, and hierarchically (is that a word? It is about those who you work with and for, and the inputs they give you).
