## Overview

Data warehousing, *a technique of consolidating all of your organizational data into one place for easier access and better analytics*, is every business stakeholder’s dream. 

However, setting up a data warehouse is a significantly complex task, and even before taking your first steps, you should be utterly clear as to what the end desired goals are for setting up a Data Warehouse.

## Setting up a Data Warehouse

Data Warehouse is extremely helpful when organizing large amounts of data to retrieve and analyze efficiently. For the same reason, extreme care should be taken to ensure that the data is rapidly accessible. One approach to designing the system is by using dimensional modeling – a method that allows large volumes of data to be efficiently and quickly queried and examined. Since most of the data present in data warehouses are historical and stable – in a sense, it doesn’t change frequently, there is hardly a need to employ repetitive backup methods. Instead, once any data is added, the entire warehouse can be backed up at once – instead of backing up routinely.

## Data Warehouse Tools

The tools needed for creation of a Data Warehouse can be broadly broken down into four core categories:

1. Extraction Tools
2. Table Management Tools
3. Query Management Tools
4. Data Integrity Tools

Each of these tools come in extremely handy at different stages of development of the Data Warehouse. Research on your part will help you understand more about these tools, and will allow you to can pick the ones which suit your needs.
