This document serves the purpose of aiding and inspiring  myself when I am discovering and documenting my [[Blog Post Ideas List]].

## Actions

1. Create a list of 50 blog post ideas - [[Blog Post Ideas List]].
2. Never let the list drop below 30 ideas. When it does, brainstorm new ideas to keep it at or above 50.
3. Pick the best 3 ideas and those will be my first three blog posts.

This will take ~30 minutes to complete. Use the full 30 minutes.

Track these ideas somewhere else if needed then migrate in during reviews.

## Brainstorming Checklist

- Tutorials and how-to's
- Book and product reviews 
- News roundups
- Commentaries on other blog posts and news articles
- Interesting stories about my life (related to my theme)
- Interviews with people in my field 
- Lists of things (Top 10 ways to ..., My 7 Favorite ...)
- Controversial / provocative posts
- Video or Vlog posts
- Guest posts (let someone else do the writing)
- Multi-part series posts (cover a much larger topic)
- Resources and links
- Case studies
- Answer a question
- Funny parody posts
- Cheat sheets
- How you solved a problem
- A problem that is currently stumping you
- Predictions about the future
- Product comparisons
- Define something

## Additional Help

### Useful Tactics

- Try looking around sites like [HackerNews](), [Reddit](), [Dev.to](), [Medium](), etc. to find posts that are popular and see if I can write a similar kind of post, but tailored to my particular theme.

- Start a conversation with someone at work about a topic or go out to lunch and talk shop. 
    - What topics came up?
    - What am I especially passionate about?
    - Direct my energy into a blog post topic from here.

- Ask someone else to come up with a few blog post titles for me.

- Come up with blog post titles that start with each letter of the alphabet. Sometimes having a constraint like this is helpful as it forces you to get creative and engage.

- Look through a book related to my theme or technology and come up with posts about each of the chapters in the book.

- Pick categories or sub-themes for posts and group post ideas into a category. Think about what categories of topics I'd like to blog about and try to come up with ~5 categories and 10 post ideas for each category.

- Don't focus on a perfect title, ideas are what's important in this initial step.
