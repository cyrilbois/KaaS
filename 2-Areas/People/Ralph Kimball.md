**Ralph Kimball** (born 1944) is an author on the subject of [data warehousing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_warehousing "Data warehousing") and [business intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_intelligence "Business intelligence"). He is one of the original architects of [data warehousing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_warehousing "Data warehousing") and is known for long-term convictions that data warehouses must be designed to be understandable and fast. His methodology, also known as [dimensional modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_modeling "Dimensional modeling") or the Kimball methodology, has become the de facto standard in the area of [decision support](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_support "Decision support").
