# SQL - SQL Server - Find the First Row of Each Group

## Description

Finding the first value in a column partitioned by some other column is simple in [[SQL]], using the `GROUP BY` clause. Returning the rest of the columns corresponding to that value is a little trickier. Here's one method, which relies on the `RANK` [[SQL - Window Functions]]:

```sql
with and_ranking as (
  select
    *,
    rank() over (partition by <partition> order by <ordering>) ranking
  from <table>
)
select * from and_ranking where ranking = 1
```

where:

- `partition` - the column(s) to partition by
- `ordering` - the column(s) which determine the ordering defining 'first'
- `table` - the source table

The [[SQL - Common Table Expressions or CTEs|CTE]] or [[SQL - Common Table Expressions or CTEs|Common Table Expression]] `and_ranking` adds a column to the original table called `ranking`, which is the order of that row within the groups defined by `partition`. Filtering for `ranking = 1` picks out those 'first' rows.

## Example

Using product sales as an example data source, we can pick the rows of the table corresponding to the most-recent order per city. Filling in the template above:

- `partition` - this is just `City`
- `ordering` - this is `Order_Date desc`
- `table` - this is `Sales`

```sql
with and_ranking as (
  select
    *,
    rank() over (partition by City order by Order_Date desc) as ranking
  from Sales
)

select * from and_ranking where ranking = 1
```
