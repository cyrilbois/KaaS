# About
  

`KaaS` (Knowledge as a Service) is an [[Obsidian]] Vault composed of a multitude of notes on a variety of topics that interest me.

Inside is my personal, customized, digital knowledge note-base structured loosely as a [[Zettelkasten]], a collection of interlinked [[Atomic Notes]] about anything that interests me.

Consider this my *Digital Garden*. It is a garden that needs to be maintained and cared for overtime to produce fruitful outcomes.

## Features

- Notes are stored locally and are written in [[Markdown]]
- Notes are versioned and tracked in [[3-Resources/Tools/Developer Tools/Version Control/_README]] with [[Git]] and [[GitHub]]
- Notes are published in two separate manners: 
	- Open Source Method: Uses [[GitHub Actions]] and [[MkDocs]] 
	- [[Obsidian Publish]]
- Hosted on my personal domain *jimbrig.com*
- Synced via [[Obsidian Sync]] between machines and for use on mobile devices and tablets
