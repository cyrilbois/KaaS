# How I Take Notes

Writing is an essential part of learning.

Through writing, one demonstrates what he/she has learned and proved he/she can explain it with words. This displays the ability to think critically and problem solve as well as absorb knowledge and curate it into wisdom for future endeavors.

Over time I have been influenced by and adopted the [[Zettelkasten]] system for note-taking (made popular by the book [How to Take Smart Notes]()).

[[Zettelkasten]] is a note taking method popularized by German sociologist Niklas Luhmann. The system is straightforward. Take notes and make connections between them. Notes are organized topically rather than chronologically or by association with a document. The act of linking between notes is explicit through manually written cross-reference. And to make it easier to connect ideas, write entries that contain one single thought.

I have been using this method for some time now. In this article, I will lay out the tools and the workflow I use. Essentially, I need something to capture ideas, a reference manager, a place to store those notes or a slip box, and an editor.
