# Highlights

Collection of highlights and annotations from:
- [[Resources/Highlights/Readwise/_README|Readwise]]
- Manual Extracted Highlights from long-form notes in this vault
- Extracted Highlights from PDFs

The [Notes Highlights Folder](Resources/Highlights/Notes/_README) contains my manual extracted highlights on notes from this vault.

The [Readwise Folder](Readwise/_README) contains my highlights synced the readwise from various sources and then brought into this vault via The [[Resources/Highlights/Readwise/_README|Readwise]] sync integration with [[Obsidian]].

Take a gander at my [[Resources/Highlights/Readwise/_README|Readwise]] Highlights Broadcast Site: [ðŸ“š James's Highlights (readwise.io)](https://readwise.io/@james688)
