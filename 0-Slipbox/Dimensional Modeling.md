# Dimensional Modeling

From Wikipedia:

**Dimensional modeling** (**DM**) is part of the *[Business Dimensional Lifecycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kimball_Lifecycle "The Kimball Lifecycle")* methodology developed by [[Ralph Kimball]] ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Kimball "Ralph Kimball")) which includes a set of methods, techniques and concepts for use in [data warehouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_warehouse "Data warehouse") design.

The approach focuses on identifying the key [business processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process "Business process") within a business and modeling and implementing these first before adding additional business processes, as a [bottom-up approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-down_and_bottom-up_design "Top-down and bottom-up design").

An alternative approach from [[Bill Inmon]] ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Inmon "Bill Inmon")) advocates a top down design of the model of all the enterprise data using tools such as [entity-relationship modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity-relationship_model "Entity-relationship model") (ER).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_modeling#cite_note-ConBegg9-1): 1258–1260
