## Capture Steps

### 1) Capture Incoming Paper into a Single In-Tray

Take a couple of minutes to perform a quick assessment of all paper and other physical *stuff* in my life right now:

|                                       What?                                        | Number of Locations |
|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:-------------------:|
|                                   Piles of Paper                                   |      ~3-5               |
|                                    Sticky Notes                                    |          N/A           |
|                                     Reminders                                      |             ~2        |
|                                     Task Lists                                     |               ~8      |
|                                Notebooks with Notes                                |                 ~10    |
|                                  Paper Calendars                                   |                  N/A   |
|                             Other Paper Products I use                             |                   ~3  |
| Miscellaneous things in or around my area that are not where or how they should be |                   ~15  |


#### 1a) Setup Two In-Trays to Serve as my "In"

Keep one tray for work and one for personal.

NOTES:



In this first step, make sure to **Capture** all *incoming stuff*. This includes:

- Email
- Papers
- Notes from Meetings
- Commitments that come up in conversations/meetings
- Ideas
- Anything on your mind that you need to remember
- Anything that has your attention
- Any coulds, woulds, shoulds, need-tos, might-want-tos, etc. 

Anything that has not already been documented.

Gather these items in a *Trusted Place*.

Note: DO NOT **Do** anything other than capture.

Ways to capture:

- Physical In-Tray
- Pen and Paper
- Smartphone
- Email and Texts
- Online Browsing and Bookmarks
