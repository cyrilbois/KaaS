# ELT Cloud Based Pipeline Architecture

## Overview

Extract, Load, Transform or ELT is the process of intaking data from a variety of raw data sources, both structured and semi/unstructured and ultimately combining them (in the cloud for this case) to create a centralized data repository that becomes accessible to business reporting/intelligence tools.

To demonstrate, the diagram below displays two data flows: one using relational data and the other using semi-structured flat files. In the end the two data flows merge into a warehouse.
